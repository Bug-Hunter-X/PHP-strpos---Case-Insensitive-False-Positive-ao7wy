This code suffers from a subtle bug related to how PHP handles string comparisons in a case-insensitive manner. The `strpos()` function, when used with the `$caseInsensitive` flag, might return a false positive if the needle is a substring of a larger string, and that larger string has different capitalization compared to the needle. For example if the haystack is 'hello World' and the needle is 'world', the case-insensitive search may find 'world' as a part of 'World'.
